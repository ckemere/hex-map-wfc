# Hex Map WFC

Procedural medieval island worlds from 4,100 hex tiles, built with WebGPU and a lot of backtracking.

## Features

- **Modular Wave Function Collapse** — 19 hexagonal grids solved independently with cross-grid constraint matching
- **Layered Recovery System** — unfixing, Local-WFC, and mountain fallbacks for 100% solve rate
- **30 Hex Tile Types** — 6 rotations and 5 elevation levels each (900 states per cell)
- **WebGPU Rendering** — Three.js with TSL shaders for all custom visual effects
- **BatchedMesh Optimization** — 4,100+ cells in ~38 draw calls, 60fps on desktop and mobile
- **Post-Processing Stack** — GTAO ambient occlusion, depth of field, vignette, and film grain
- **Dynamic Shadow Maps** — frustum fitted to camera view for crisp shadows at any zoom
- **Animated Water** — caustic sparkles and coastal waves with cove-aware thinning
- **Noise-Based Placement** — Perlin noise for organic tree, building, and decoration clustering
- **Seeded RNG** — deterministic, reproducible maps from any seed
